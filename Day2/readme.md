## Monolithic and Microservices App Structures

Monolithic:
- All application components are in 1 codebase
- Hard to maintain
- If a service failed, the whole application will fail

Microservice:
- Different application components are their own standalone services and are interconnected together to make the application run all as 1 entity
- Easier to maintain (Distributed development, specific people are responsible for specific functionalities)
- If service fail, only that service fail, without effecting other services
