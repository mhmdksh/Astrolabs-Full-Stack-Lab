# Day 4 (System Security Part 1)
## System Security Best Practices
1. Data Protection and Privacy
- Privacy by Design
- Encryption (At Rest 'JWT' & In-Transit 'SSL/TLS')
## Secure Development Practices
1. Secure Coding: Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDOS Attacks
2. Code Reviews and Static Analysis: Regularly perform code reviews and use static analysis tools to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
3. Dependency Management: Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up to date to protect against vulnerabilities found in older versions.
4. Secure APIs: Given that fintech applications often rely on APIs for integration with banks and other financial institutions, it's crucial to ensure that these APIs are secure. This includes implementing rate limiting, authentication, and encryption.
